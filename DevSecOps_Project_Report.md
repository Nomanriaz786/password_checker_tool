## 2. Introduction

### Background and Context
In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, with password-related vulnerabilities accounting for over 80% of data breaches [1]. Traditional software development approaches often treat security as an afterthought, leading to expensive remediation efforts and increased risk exposure [2]. Our project addresses these challenges by implementing a security-first approach using DevSecOps methodologies [3].

The Password Strength Checker application serves as a practical demonstration of how security can be embedded throughout the development lifecycle while maintaining rapid delivery and high-quality code. The application provides users with advanced password analysis capabilities, including entropy calculation, dictionary attack simulation, and intelligent password generation.

### Importance of Cybersecurity in Modern Software Development
Modern software development faces unprecedented security challenges:
- **Increased Attack Surface**: Cloud-native applications expose more potential vulnerabilities
- **Rapid Development Cycles**: DevOps practices can inadvertently introduce security gaps
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Growing requirements for data protection (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Third-party dependencies introduce additional risk vectors
- **Advanced Persistent Threats**: Sophisticated attackers target development pipelines

### Overview of DevSecOps and Project Relevance
DevSecOps represents the evolution of DevOps, integrating security practices throughout the software development lifecycle. Key principles include:

**Shift Left Security**: Moving security testing earlier in the development process to identify and resolve vulnerabilities before they reach production [4]. Our project implemented security scanning in the IDE, during commits, and throughout the CI/CD pipeline.

**Automation**: Automated security testing, vulnerability scanning, and compliance checking reduce manual effort and human error [4]. We implemented automated SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning tools.

**Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between development, security, and operations teams [3]. Our project demonstrated cross-functional collaboration with security champions in each development team.

**Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and incident response capabilities [2]. We implemented comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting systems.
